•0 – ⭑WE WİLL NOT⭑ make any NDAs (Non-disclosure agreements), trade secrets, or any kind of agreement with any organization (no matter if they are governmental or non-governmental) to hide technical data from our [licensee/end-user]s or to embed malicious features (including backdoors, malwares, etc.), intending to [harm/spy/eavesdrop] the [licensee/end-user]s, in our [produc/t/echnologie]s. İf anyone attempts to do this in our [distribution/release/publication] of [produc/t/echnologie]s or contact us to do so, we will refuse it and report them to the community A.S.A.P (as soon as possible). THİS WİLL BE DONE EVEN İN THE CASES İN THAT THE LAW MANDATES THE EMBEDDİNG OF SUCH FEATURES OR FORBİDS TO MAKE SUCH REPORTS. İn these cases, we have the following options:

0.1 – Take legal action.

0.2 – Outright refusal to abide by the law (civil disobedience).

0.3 – Move to another [country/jurisdiction].

0.4 – Cease our operations (closing our organization).

•1 – We will NOT embed in our [produc/t/echnologie]s features that:

1.1 – Are [proprietary/closed] source (even if these «binary blobs» are used in drivers or in an external manner, like ƒіrmware) or use non-libre licenses. [produc/t/echnologie]s with obfuscated source-code will also not be admitted.

1.2 – Are under a License that makes restrictions based on discrimination against speciƒіc [licensee/end-user]s, groups, activities or ƒіelds of study.

1.3 – Have any malicious features (including backdoors, malwares, etc.), intending to [harm/spy/eavesdrop] the [licensee/end-user]s.

1.4 – Uses creative material (including, but not limited to, visual arts, and creative writing) based on A.I. (Artificial Intelligence), as this kind of material has raised concerns about its copyright.

•2 – Our preference for licenses are in the following order:

2.1 – Public Domain.

2.2 – Components with permissive licenses can be used permanently, but will preferably be replaced by those of the item 2.1 when possible.

2.3 – [produc/t/echnologie]s with «Copyleft» or «Viral» licenses can be admitted temporarily, but will preferably be replaced by those of the items 2.2 and 2.1, A.S.A.P (as soon as possible).

•3 – Any technical problems («bugs») will be reported to the community A.S.A.P (as soon as possible).

•4 – We will recommend and, as far as our resources allow us to do so, help to fund the development of Libre-licensed [produc/t/echnologie]s, with the same aforementioned preference system, aiming to be an alternative to [closed/proprietary/non-libre/obfuscated-sourced] ones, that are eventually used by, and embedded in, other [project/organization]s.
