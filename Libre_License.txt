***

•The [distribution/release/publication] of the [produc/t/echnologie]s covered by this License (ƒuскіng recursion) in any form must come w/ the proper İP (İntellectual Property) notice, and this License (ƒuскіng recursion), in a reasonably accessible way. This text (ƒuскіng recursion) must come in a constant letter size, to avoid the [small/ƒіne] print problem.

•Anyone ⭑CAN⭑ [crea/distribu]te [proprietary/closed/obfuscated]-sourced [produc/t/echnologie]s under this License (ƒuскіng recursion), provided that they respect the terms of this License (ƒuскіng recursion) normally.

•Anti-Piracy Clause – The licensors (or the [provid/suppli/manufactur]ers) of the [produc/t/echnologie]s covered by this License (ƒuскіng recursion), ⭑HAVE THE RİGHT⭑ to embed malicious features (including backdoors, malwares, etc.), intending to [harm/spy/eavesdrop/expose] the [licensee / end-user]s that [obtain/us]ed pirated versions of the [produc/t/echnologie]s under this License (ƒuскіng recursion). Both the licensors (or the [provid/suppli/manufactur]ers) and the [licensee / end-user]s have the right to take techn[nolog]ical (not legal) measures, countermeasures, and anti-countermeasures against each other, in order to [prevent/ensure/enforce] this; and so forth, in an ⭑ad æternum⭑ (endless) techn[nolog]ical arms race.

•Anyone ⭑CAN⭑ [crea/distribu]te NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) under this License (ƒuскіng recursion), provided that they respect the terms of this License (ƒuскіng recursion) normally, and take the responsibility for their own acts. Objection: «But the NFTs for a game are useless if the gaming company goes bankrupt, and the servers of the game become offline.». Answer: The gamers that buy it already know that, so they chose to take this risk; furthermore, if the company uses a non-blockchain option and goes bankrupt, the items will be lost in the same way. Objection: «But it’s a Ponzi Scheme scam.». Answer: Those who buy it already know that, so they chose to take this risk; if you think that NTFs are an inherent Ponzi Scheme scam, you have the following options: notify the authorities, or use your freedom of speech to publicly speak against it (raising the public awareness about it). Objection: «But people are buying bad art for a high price.». Answer: This is THEİR money, so this is THEİR problem. Objection: «This is an economic bubble.». Answer: This is the money of the buyers and sellers, so this is THEİR problem; furthermore, when an economic bubble bursts, most of its bad investments automatically go bankrupt, while most of the good investments survive. Objection: «People are making [racist/Nazi/fascist/pedophile] material w/ the NFT technology.». Answer: People have been making such kinds of material since times predating the existence of the [Web/internet]; if you saw such a kind of material, you have the following options: notify the authorities (supposing that the [crea/distribu]tion of this kind of art is a crime in the jurisdiction), or [crea/distribu]te yourself a better anti-[racist/Nazi/fascist/pedophile] material. Objection: «The technology for the NFTs is power-hungry, releasing carbon into the atmosphere.». Answer: İf you want to save the world by saving electric energy, just stop watching gay pornography; if you’re worried w/ about the carbon, just stop smoking [weed/marijuana/cannabis/ganja]. One ƒіnal consideration: people have been pirating copyrighted works since the advent of the computing, and the members of certain militant groups don’t even blink an eye; but [crea/distribu]te a NFT, and everyone loses their minds. Bottom line: it’s simply irrational to prohibit the [crea/distribu]tion of NFTs just because of such objections.

•Providing the [produc/t/echnologie]s covered by this License (ƒuскіng recursion) as a service (even through a network) DOESN’T exempt anyone from following this License’s (ƒuскіng recursion) terms.

•This License (ƒuскіng recursion) grants to the [licensee / end-user]s the unrestricted right to redistribute copies of this [produc/t/echnologie]s, in original or modiƒіed forms, no matter if it’s in a commercial or non-commercial form; however, the modiƒіed forms must be clearly identiƒіed as that, in order to avoid them to be mistaken w/ the original version distributed by the licensors, and this also applies to the logotypes, names, and trademarks used.

•Creating modiƒіed forms of the [produc/t/echnologie]s covered by this License (ƒuскіng recursion) constitutes it as a derivative work.

•Non-Endorsement Clause – Anyone ⭑HAVE⭑ the right to make statements of compatibility between any [produc/t/echnologie]s platforms and the [produc/t/echnologie]s platforms covered by this License (ƒuскіng recursion).

•The licensors give the [permission/grant] to technical countermeasures to be taken in order to circumvent the technical measures that they may put in the [produc/t/echnologie]s covered by this License (ƒuскіng recursion) preventing [modiƒіed/competing/alternative] technologies from being [executed/ran/used] in them; obviously, this also includes the [permission/grant] to [execute/run/use] these [modiƒіed/competing/alternative] technologies.

•Anyone can [execute/run/use/study/modify] the [produc/t/echnologie]s covered by this License (ƒuскіng recursion) for any purpose (however, the licensors are automatically exempt from any liability for any [harm/damages/conseqüences] that may arise from this), including, but not limited to, purposes of warfare, [chemical/biological/nuclear] weapons, crime, and terrorism.

•Any legal measures taken by the licensors or their legal representatives, to negate or restrict any right given by this License (ƒuскіng recursion), are automatically [void/null/cancelled].

•Anyone can study the technologies covered by this License (ƒuскіng recursion) , and this includes the [permission/grant] to do it through reverse engineering; this also includes the [permission/grant] to in[vade/tercept] (in either physical or [virtual/informational/digital/analog] form) the (but not limited to these) [server/facilitie/premise/building/factory/installation/correspondence]s of the licensors, ⭑[SOL/EXCLUSİV]ELY FOR THE PURPOSES AND SCOPE OF STUDYİNG AND REVERSE ENGİNEERİNG OF THE [PRODUCT/TECHNOLOGİE]S COVERED İN THİS LİCENSE⭑ (so this License (ƒuскіng recursion) CAN’T be used as ex[cuse/emption] to the in[vade/tercepto]rs to commit crimes against the licensors, or anyone else).

Also, the licensors, or the [provid/suppli/manufactur]ers of the [produc/t/echnologie]s covered by this License (ƒuскіng recursion), have the normal rights to cancel or otherwise modify the existing warranty of the provided [produc/t/echnologie]s if it was proven that the method employed in the [reverse engineering / invasion], or the [execution/running/use] of [modiƒіed/competing/alternative] technologies, inside these products, caused [damage/harm/malfunction] on them. The [cancell/alter]ation of the warranty must be proportional and coherent w/ the [damage/harm/malfunction] that was caused.

•This License (ƒuскіng recursion) ⭑per se⭑ (by itself) DOESN’T constitute in any kind of legal [service/consulting/advice] among the ones involved in this License (ƒuскіng recursion); as such, it DOESN’T constitute a [lawyer/attorney/solicitor/barrister/mentor]-[client/customer/protégée] relationship among them.
